# StartCHAIN
StartCHAIN is a blockchain-based crowdfunding platform to promote crowdfunding for start-ups with the help of blockchain technology. The name StartCHAIN comes from a combination of two primary words that describe the motive of this project, that is, ‘Start-ups’ and ‘Blockchain’.
1. Founders and backers are the intended end users of the system.
2. The founders can easily create campaigns by posting some basic details like campaign name, description, fund amount required, milestones to be achieved, and so on to raise funds for their innovative start-up idea while backers can invest in the project which seems reliable and profitable to them. 
3. StartCHAIN will provide direct communication between project developers and individual investors which will increase the speed of the transaction process and will not create any longer delays. 
4. Each time to get the funds, the founder would need to request backers. And without the consensus of all backers, the founder would not
be able to use the received funds.
5. Admin act as a financial manager of the system who manages the money in all the backer's wallet (which is used by them to fund projects).
6. Thus, the proposed system aims on providing transparency, low latency, trust and reliability between both founders and backers.
